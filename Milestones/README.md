## Use case

 In the event of a pandemic, measures must be taken to prevent the spread of the contagion. healthcare facilitys are required to screen patients and separate those in need of contagion testing from others. This process must be conducted in an orderly manner, informing patients of the expected wait time and notifying them when they can be admitted.

Your task is to assist in completing the implementation of the Pre-Triage application, which will be used in such scenarios.

### The Pre-Triage Application
The application starts by displaying a simple menu with three options:
```Text
Ontario Pre-Triage Application for Healthcare Facilities
1- Register
2- Admit
0- Exit
>
```
#### Register
The register option is selected to screen patients before getting into the healthcare facility. The user can select between a contagion Test or Triage.

Contagion test is selected if the patient is at the healthcare facility for a contagion Test. In this case, the patient's name and OHIP number is entered and then a ticket will be printed with a call number and estimated wait time for admission for the patient.

If Triage is selected then in addition to the patient's name and OHIP number, the symptoms of the patient are entered. Then a ticket for Triage is printed with an estimated wait time for admission.

#### Admit
Admit is selected when the contagion Test area or the Triage section is ready to accept a patient. After selecting contagion or Triage, the patient with the next ticket in line will be called. Based on the time of the call, the average wait time for the next patient for that line up (contagion or Triage) will be updated.

## Milestones due dates
This project will be completed in five milestones, with each milestone having a specified due date. The due date for each milestone is determined based on the amount of work required to achieve it.

To ensure successful completion of the project within the given timeframe, I recommend starting early and diligently meeting all the milestone due dates.

> Remember: Early preparation and timely progress are key to project success. Best of luck with your project!

### Milestone 5 submissions
- **Due date**: Apr 8th
- Project submission **rejection date**: Apr 13th 23:59
- Late Submission Penalty: A 10% deduction per day will be applied for late submissions, up to a maximum of 5 days. After 5 days, the submission will receive a mark of zero.

> To facilitate the final project submission and allow partial submissions, we have divided Milestone 5 into six smaller parts. Each submission contributes 10% to the overall project grade. Your project will be evaluated only if you have completed all four milestones and submitted at least one of the six parts for Milestone 5. 

|Milestone 5<br/> Divided into<br/>Six submission| Description | Comments |
|:------|:---|-------|
| [m51](#milestone-51) |  | Mandatory, this is needed for the rest<br /> of the options to be functional|
| [m52](#milestone-52) |  | Optional with 10% penalty |
| [m53](#milestone-53) |  | Optional with 10% penalty |
| [m54](#milestone-54) |  | Optional with 10% penalty |
| [m55](#milestone-55) |  | Optional with 10% penalty |
| [m56](#milestone-56) |  | Optional with 10% penalty |


#### Milestones 1 to 4: Success and Timely Submissions
- The first four milestones will not be evaluated based on the code itself. Instead, their assessment will focus on success (meeting project objectives) and timely submissions. During these milestones, you have the flexibility to modify or debug your previous code as needed.
- If you require any feedback on your first four milestones you need to ask your professor to do so.
#### Milestone 5: Code Scrutiny
- **Milestone** 5 is the critical phase where your code will be closely examined. Ensure that your implementation aligns with project requirements and best practices. 

***NOTE:***<br/>
**Your project will receive a mark of zero if any of the milestones are not submitted by [the rejection date](#milestone-5-submissions)<br />For your project to be marked, you must submit all the first 4 milestones and at least part 1 of the 6 submissions of Milestone 5**

### Checking Due dates using the submitter program


You can check the due date of each milestone using the ```-due``` flag in the submission command when the submissions are set up:
```bash
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/m? -due
```
- replace **2??** with the subject code
- replace **m?** with the milestone number

## Citation, Sources

When submitting your work, all the files submitted should carry full student information along with the "citation and sources" information. See the following example:

If you have multiple submissions of the same milestone, please update the Revision History in each submission so your professor knows what changes to look for.

```c++

**Failing to include the above citation to any of the files containing your work will cause the rejection of your project submission**

## Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: the compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++11`: the code will be compiled using the c++11 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ws`: the compiled application will be named `ws`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as follows to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ws`):

```bash
valgrind --show-error-list=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ws
```

- `--show-error-list=yes`: show the list of detected errors
- `--leak-check=full`: check for all types of memory problems
- `--show-leak-kinds=all`: show all types of memory leaks identified (enabled by the previous flag)
- `--track-origins=yes`: tracks the origin of uninitialized values (`g++` must use `-g` flag for compilation, so the information displayed here is meaningful).

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use *diff* available on `matrix`.

> All the code written in the project must be implemented in the **seneca** namespace.

> Make sure that all the debugging code and debugging comments are removed before submission.

## Project Implementation notes:  *Very Important, read carefully*

### 1- Namespace Requirement:
- All code written for this project must be within the seneca namespace.
### 2- Flexibility in Adding Attributes and Methods:
- You are encouraged to add any necessary attributes (member variables), functions, and methods (member functions) to complete your code.
- If unsure about your strategy for adding functionalities and properties to your classes, seek advice from your professor.
### 3- Private Methods:
- If you add methods that are not called outside the scope of the class, ensure they are set as private.
### 4- Naming Conventions:
- Unless explicitly instructed otherwise, name variables and functions as you find fit.
- Follow the naming conventions provided by your professor and subject notes
- Meaningless or misleading names may result in penalties.
### 5- Constant Member Functions:
- When creating methods (member functions), set them as constant if they do not modify their class.
### 6- Passing by Address or Reference:
- When passing an object or variable by address or reference, use constant pointers and references if they are not meant to be modified.
### 7- Empty State Consideration:
- If an empty state is required for an object, it should be considered an “invalid” empty state.
Objects in this state should be rendered unusable.
### 8- Utils Module:
- A module named Utils is included in the project.
- If you don’t have custom functionalities, leave the Utils module as is.
- You can add your own code to the Utils module, but do not modify existing functionalities provided for testing and system time retrieval purposes.
### 9- Code Reuse:
- You may reuse and copy any code provided by your professor in workshops or functions from previous work in this subject or other subjects.
- Place such code in the Utils module as needed and cite it.
### 10 - Display and Input Methods

- For any class that requires a display or print functionality, the method should adhere to the following format, unless specified otherwise:
   ```c++
   ostream& displayMethod(ostream& ostr = cout) const;
   ```
   This displayMethod function takes an ostream reference as an argument, with a default value of cout. It returns an ostream reference, allowing for chained insertion operations. The const qualifier ensures that the method does not modify any class members.

- For any class that requires scanning or reading from input, the method should adhere to the following format, unless specified otherwise:
   ```c++
   istream& readMethod(istream& istr = cin);
   ```
   The readMethod function takes an istream reference as an argument, with a default value of cin. It returns an istream reference, enabling chained extraction operations. This method is used to read or scan data into the class members.

   These methods provide a standard interface for output and input operations, enhancing the usability and flexibility of your classes.
 


# Milestone 1 

## Utils Module
The `Utils` module is a versatile component of your project. It currently includes methods for retrieving system time. In debugging mode, the system time is simulated to facilitate testing and development.

The module is designed with extensibility in mind. You are encouraged to add custom methods and functionalities to this module or class as needed. This approach promotes code reuse and helps maintain consistent logic across your project.

The `Utils` module is instantiated globally, making it accessible to any module that includes “Utils.h”. It is available under the alias `U`. This global availability ensures that its methods can be conveniently used wherever needed in your project.

Remember to refer to the comments within the module for a deeper understanding of how it operates. These comments can serve as a valuable guide as you work with the Utils module or extend its capabilities.

## Startup

To initiate the project, we will develop two modules: `Time` and `Menu`. The `Time` module will manage the progression of time and add timestamps to appointment tickets. The `Menu` module drives the main user interface of the application.

## Time Module
The first step in tracking time for issued tickets is to implement a Time class.

The `Time` class is designed to:
- Read and write time in HH:MM format.
- Measure the passage of time.
- Calculate the estimated wait time.

The `Time` module stores time solely in minutes (one attribute for minutes). However, it displays and reads time in the `HH:MM` format. For instance, if the `Time` object holds the value ***125***, it will display as ***02:05***. Similarly, if the time ***13:55*** is read by the Time object from istream, it stores ***835*** in the object (i.e., 13x60+55). Note that the `Time` object can also be used to measure the passage of time, and there is no limit to the number of minutes it can hold. It can exceed 24 hours if necessary.

> Note: ***125:15*** is a valid time that represents 125 hours and 15 minutes. Also, ***0:96*** is a valid entry and it is displayed as ***01:36***, which is ***1*** hour and ***36*** minutes.

Complete the implementation of the Time class with the following mandatory specs:  

### Attributes
The Time has one mandatory attribute to keep number of minutes. 

### Methods

```c++
Time& reset();  
```
This method resets the `Time` object to the current time using the `U.getTime()` method, which is available in the Utils module. It then returns a reference to the current object.

> Note: If the `seneca::debug` flag is set to true, or if the `U.setDebugTime()` method is called, the `U.getTime()` function will return a simulated system time. This feature is useful for debugging purposes and when submitting your work through the submitter program.

```c++
Time(unsigned int min = 0u); 
```
This constructor initializes a `Time` object. It sets the number of minutes held in the object to the value provided in the min parameter. If no value is provided, it defaults to zero, effectively setting the time to zero.

```c++
write
```
This method writes the time into ostream in the `HH:MM` format. If the hours or minutes are single-digit numbers, it pads them with a leading zero. For example, it formats the times as `03:02`, `16:55`, and `234:06`.


```c++
read
```
This method reads the time from istream in the `H:M` format. It ensures that the two integers (hours and minutes) are separated by a colon (`:`). If they are not, it sets the istream object to a failure state.

Please note that this function does not handle any invalid data. It simply follows these steps:

- Reads the integer for the hours using istream.
- Check the next character and verifies if it is `:` and discards is. If it is not, it sets the istream object to a failure state by executing the method: `istr.setstate(ios::failbit);`.
- Reads the integer for the minutes using istream.

- >Note: Do not clear or flush the istream as this method adheres to the istream standards. The caller of this function may check the istream state to ensure that the read operation was successful, if necessary.

```c++
operator unsigned int()const;
```
This operator overloads the cast to `unsigned int` for the `Time` class. If a `Time` object is cast to an unsigned integer, it will return the number of minutes held in the object.

```c++
Time& operator*= (int val);
```
This operator overloads the multiplication assignment `*=` for the `Time` class. It multiplies the number of minutes held in the Time object by val, then returns a reference to the current object.

```c++
Time& operator-= (const Time& D);
```

This operator overloads the subtraction assignment `-=` for the `Time` class. It calculates the time difference between the current Time object and the Time object `D` passed as an argument. Note that the difference can never be a negative value. If the result would be negative, it adds 24 hours (or 1440 minutes) to ensure the result is positive. Here are some examples:

- `23:00 -= 9:00` results in `14:00`.
- `18:00 -= 16:00` results in `2:00`.
- `1:00 -= 22:00` results in `3:00`. This is calculated as ((**1:00** + 24:00) - **22:00**).

See the illustration below:
![Time](images/time.png)

```c++
Time operator-(const Time& T)const;
```
This operator performs the same calculation as the subtraction assignment `-=` overload, except that it does not have a side effect (i.e., it does not modify the current object).

It returns a new `Time` object representing the time difference between the current `Time` object and the `Time` object `T`.

```c++
operator<<
```
Overload the insertion operator to be able to insert a Time object into an ostream object as described in the write method.
```c++
operator>>
```
Overload the extraction operator to be able to extract data from an istream object into the Time object as described in the read method.

## Time Tester
The following program is a tester for the Time class.

[timeTester.cpp](ms1/timeTester.cpp)


## Menu Module
Create a Menu class that encapsulates a menu and provides selection functionality for the caller program.

### Suggested attributes
- A constant char pointer to hold the content of the menu to be displayed
- An Integer to hold the number of options in the menu
- An integer to hold the number of indetation tabs


```c++
 Menu(const char* menuContent, int numberOfTabs = 0);
```
This constructor is designed to initialize a `Menu` object. It takes two parameters: a pointer to a character string `menuContent`, and an optional integer `numberOfTabs` with a default value of `0`.

The constructor dynamically allocates memory to store the content pointed to by `menuContent` in the member variable `m_text`. It then scans `m_text` to count the number of newline characters (`\n`), which is used to determine the number of options in the menu.

The `numberOfTabs` parameter specifies the number of indentation tabs to be applied when displaying the menu. This allows for flexible formatting of the menu display. If not provided, no tabs will be applied by default.

```c++
 ~Menu();
```
Deallocates the dynamically allocated memory.

```Text
Copy and assignment
```
Makes sure the Menu can not be copied or assigned to another Menu object.

```text
display
```

The display method is responsible for presenting the `Menu` content to the user. It first outputs the menu options and a new line. Following the list of options, it prints:

```text
0- Exit
> _
```
This provides an option for the user to exit the menu and also indicates where the user can input their choice.

If the number of tabs attribute is not zero, the display method will indent the menu. Each tab corresponds to three spaces. This allows for adjustable formatting of the menu display.

Here are examples of how the menu would be displayed:

A menu with no indentation (i.e., `number of tabs` is `0`):

```text
Tester Options menu:
1- Option one
2- Option two
0- Exit
>
```
A menu with `number of tabs` set to`2`:
```text
      Tester Options menu:
      1- Option one
      2- Option two
      0- Exit
      >
```
In the second example, each line of the menu is indented by six spaces (two tabs * three spaces per tab) for a more structured visual presentation. This feature enhances the flexibility and user-friendliness of your menu system.

```c++
int& operator>>(int& Selection);
```
The member insertion operator first calls the display function and then receives the user's selection as an integer value. The integer reference **selection** argument is then set to this value and returned.<br />
Make sure that the entered value is validated as an integer (with no trailing characters) and also the value should be between 0 and the **number of options** in the menu.<br />
If the above conditions are not met, a proper error message should be displayed and re-entry requested(see below)

Assuming that the menu content is set to:```"Tester Options menu:\n1- Option one\n2- Option two\n3- Option three"``` , (hence the number of selections will 3) the **operator>>** should run like this:
```Text
Tester Options menu:
1- Option one
2- Option two
3- Option three
0- Exit
> abc
Bad integer value, try again: 1 (with a space after 1)
Only enter an integer, try again: -1
Invalid value enterd, retry[0 <= value <= 3]: 4
Invalid value enterd, retry[0 <= value <= 3]: 2
```
`2` is returned as user's selection.

## [Back to milestones](#milestones)
# Milestone 2  

## IOAble interface module

In milestone 1 we have created the utility classes needed to have the menu selection and Time display and calculations.<br />
Now we need to create the core classes of the application.  The diagram below displays the core classes of the application and their relationship.

![Classes](images/classes.png)

Create a class called **IOAble**.  This class is [an interface](https://intro2oop.sdds.ca/E-Polymorphism/abstract-base-classes#interface) and enforces the implementation of input and output methods to its derived classes.<br />
The IOAble class has only [2 pure virtual](https://intro2oop.sdds.ca/E-Polymorphism/abstract-base-classes#pure-virtual-function) methods:

## [Pure Virtual](https://intro2oop.sdds.ca/E-Polymorphism/abstract-base-classes#pure-virtual-function) Functions:

### write
This pure virtual function is for future ostream outputs.
It receives a reference of an ostream and returns a reference of an ostream. This function is incapable of changing the current object.
### read
This pure virtual function is for future istream inputs.
It receives a reference of istream and returns a reference of an istream.
### virtual destructor
This class also has an empty virtual destructor.

## Insertion and Extraction helper operator overloads.
### operator<<
Overload the insertion operator to be able to insert the information of an IOAble object into ostream using the IOAble::write function.
### operator>>
Overload the extraction operator to be able to extract information from an istream into an IOAble object using the IOAble::read function.

## The tester program.
Read and study the tester program and understand how it works.  It is a very good example to show how an interface is used as a base class.  It also can help you in the development of the upcoming milestones.

## Utils Module
A function called "strcmp" is added to the Utils module that works exactly like the strcmp in the `<cstring>` header file to run the tester progam in main.cpp. 

Please copy and add it to your own Utils Module.


## The Patient Module

Develop an abstract base class named Patient, which inherits from the IOAble interface. The Patient class is designed to encapsulate the attributes and behaviors of a generic patient arriving at a healthcare facility. In subsequent stages of the project (specifically milestone 4), this Patient class will serve as a base class for two derived classes: TestPatient and TriagePatient. These derived classes will represent specific types of patients, each with their unique characteristics and needs. The Patient class, therefore, forms the foundation of our Pre-Triage management system in this healthcare context.

Please note that the Patient class is abstract, meaning it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it defines a common interface for its derived classes. This design promotes code reuse and polymorphism, key principles of object-oriented programming.

Remember, the purpose of this module is to provide a robust and flexible structure for managing two different types of patient types in the system. As you progress through the project, consider how the design of the Patient class and its derived classes can best meet this goal. 

The following are the mandatory properties of the patient class.

### Attributes of the Patient Class
The `Patient` class must include the following member variables and objects:

#### Patient name
A dynamically allocated C-string, represented by a character pointer variable, is used to store the patient’s name. This allows for names of varying lengths to be stored efficiently. 

> While the memory for the name attribute is dynamically allocated, we will operate under the assumption that a `Patient`'s name will not exceed 50 characters in length. If the input provided for the name attribute surpasses 50 characters, it should be silently truncated to the first 50 characters. This truncation should occur without raising any errors. This approach ensures that our program can handle a variety of input lengths while maintaining a consistent data structure size for the name attribute.

#### OHIP number
An integer attruibute is used to store the patient’s OHIP (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) number. This number should consist of exactly 9 digits, reflecting the standard format of OHIP numbers.
#### Ticket
A Ticket object is used to represent the patient’s ticket for the lineup. This object encapsulates all relevant information about the patient’s position in the queue, such as their arrival time and priority level.


### Constructor 
Instantiate a Patient object by providing a ticket number (an integer). This ticket number will be utilized to initialize the Ticket member attribute.

### Copying and assignment.
Ensure that a Patient object can be safely copied or assigned to another Patient without encountering memory leaks or any associated issues.

### Destructor
Implement a destructor for the Patient class that effectively deallocates any dynamically allocated memory, thereby preventing memory leaks.


### Member functions
#### char type()
Create a pure virtual function called **type** that returns a character and is incapable of modifying the current object.
In future derived objects, this function will return a single character that identifies the type of the patient (Contagion test patient or Triage patient).


#### Operator== Overloads
##### Patient Comparison to a Character
Overload the `operator==` to compare the current object with a single character (the right operand). Return true if the values returned by the type function of this patient and the provided single character are identical. Note that this operator should not modify the current object.

##### Comparing to Another Patient
Overload the `operator==` to compare the current object to another patient. Return true if the type of the current patient is the same as the type of the other patient; otherwise, return false. This operator should not have the ability to modify either the current object or the right operand.

#### Setting the Patient's Arrival Time
Implement a modifier method named `setArrivalTime` within the Patient class. This method sets the time of the patient's ticket to the current time. It does not take any parameters and does not return any value.

#### Getting the Patient's Arrival TIme
Create a query method named `time` to retrieve the time of the patient's ticket and return it.

#### Patient's Ticket Number
Establish a query method named `number` that returns the number associated with the patient's ticket.

### Cast Overloads
#### Boolean
When a patient is casted to a boolean, return true if the Patient is in a valid state; otherwise, return false.

#### Const Character Pointer
If a patient is casted to a constant character pointer, return the address of the patient's name.


### pure virtual function overwrites.

### Writing Patient Information into `ostream`
This method inserts information into the ostream reference in three different formats based on the instance of the ostream. For `cout`, it inserts detailed information suitable for printing like a ticket in multiline format. For `clog`, it presumes a list is being printed, and therefore the information is inserted in a linear format suitable for a list. For any other object, it will insert the values in a comma-separated format suitable for saving in a file.

Overwrite the `write` method to insert patient information into the `ostream` as follows:

1. If the patient is being inserted into the `clog` object, the information is displayed in a linear format as follows:

   - If the patient is in an invalid empty state 
      - Insert "Invalid Patient Record".
   - Otherwise
      - Insert the name of the patient in 53 spaces, left-justified, padded with '.' characters.
      - Insert the OHIP number.
      - Insert the ticket number in 5 spaces, right-justified.
      - Insert a space.
      - Insert the ticket time.

2. If the patient is being inserted into the `cout` object, the information is inserted as follows:

   - If the patient is in an invalid empty state 
      - Insert "Invalid Patient Record" and go to a newline.
   - Otherwise
      - Insert the member ticket object.
      - Insert a newline character.
      - Insert the patient's name.
      - Insert ", OHIP: ".
      - Insert the OHIP number.
      - Insert a newline character.
      - Return the ostream.

3. If the patient is not being inserted into the `cout` or `clog` object, the information is presented in a comma-separated value format:

   - Insert the following values into the ostream in a comma-separated format. After the values are inserted, add a single "comma", and then call the write function of the member ticket object. Finally, return the ostream.

   - The sequence of values inserted into the ostream is as follows:

      ```Text
      returned value of the type() function
      ','
      name of the patient
      ','
      OHIP number
      ','
      ```
     and then insert the ticket.


### Reading Patient Information from `istream`
Overwrite the read method to extract patient information from the `istream` as follows:

If the information is being extracted from `cin` (user input over the console), the following actions are taken:

- Display the prompt: "Name: ".
- Extract the name of the patient from the `istream` up to 50 characters or the newline character into a local Cstring of 51 characters using `istream`'s `get`.
- Copy the extracted name into dynamically allocated memory pointed by the name member variable, ensuring the name pointer is deleted before the allocation to prevent memory leaks.
- Extract and ignore all characters up to and including the newline character.
- Display the prompt: "OHIP: ".
- Extract a 9-digit OHIP number from the istream. Validate it, ensuring it is between 100000000 and 999999999. Use the same error message format as the Menu item selection.
- Return the istream reference at the end.

Execution example:

```Text
Name: John Doe
OHIP: abc
Bad integer value, try again: 100
Invalid value entered, retry [100000000 <= value <= 999999999]: 123123123
```

If the information is **not** being extracted from `cin`, presuming it is being read from a file, the information should be read in comma-separated format as follows:

- Extract the name of the patient from the `istream` up to 50 characters or a comma character into a local Cstring of 51 characters.
- Copy the extracted name into dynamically allocated memory pointed by the name member variable, ensuring the name pointer is deleted before the allocation to prevent memory leaks.
- Extract and ignore all characters up to and including a comma character using istream's ignore.
- Extract an integer from the istream into the OHIP member variable.
- End the extraction by calling the read method of the patient's ticket.
- Return the istream reference at the end.

If, in any case, the istream fails to read the information, ensure that any dynamically allocated memory held by the name attribute is deleted, and the pointer is set to nullptr.

# Milestone 4

Advance the development of the Pre-triage application by incorporating the `test patient` and `triage patien` modules into the system.

## The TestPatient module
This module has one integer global variable called **nextTestTicket** that is initialized to **one**.  This global variable will be used to determine what is the ticket number of the next contagion test Patient.  Each time a new **TestPatient** object is created the value of the **nextTestTicket** will be increased by **one**.  The scope of the global **nextTestTicket** variable is only the **TestPatient** module.

The **TestPatient** class is publicly derived from the **Patient** class. The **TestPatient** class does not add any member variables or properties to the **Patient** module.

The **TestPatient** class has one **default constructor**, implements the pure virtual **type()** function and re-implements the four **read and write** functions of the base class **Patient** as follows:

### Default Constructor
The default constructor passes the **nextTestTicket** global variable to the **constructor** of the base class **Patient** and then it will increase the value of **nextTestTicket** global variable by **one**.

### the type() virtual function
This function only returns the character **'C'**;

### csvWrite virtual function override.
This function only calls the **csvWrite** function of the base class **Patient** and returns the **ostream** reference.

### csvRead virtual function override
First this function will call the **csvRead** function of the base class **Patient**, then it will set the **nextTestTicket** global variable to the return value of the **number()** function of the **Patient** class plus **one**. 

Finally, it will return the ~~ostream~~ istream reference.

### write virtual function override.
If the ostream is cout it will insert **"Contagion TEST"** into the **ostream** object and goes to **newline**. 

Then it will call the **write()** function of the base class **Patient**.

At end it will return the **ostream** reference.

### read virtual function override. 
It will call the read function of the base class **Patient**.

If the istream is not cin (reading from a file) then it should set the **nextTestTicket** to the ticket number of this patient + 1. This will make sure the ticket numbers are correctly restored with records are being read from a file.

Then it will return the **istream** reference.

### Destructor
This class does not need a custom destructor.

### TestPatient tester and output
[TstP_Tester.cpp](ms4/TstP_Tester.cpp)

## The TriagePatient Module
This module includes a single integer global variable called `nextTriageTicket` initialized to `one`. This global variable determines the ticket number of the next triage Patient. Each time a new TriagePatient is created, the value of `nextTriageTicket` increases by one. The scope of the global `nextTriageTicket` variable is limited to the `TriagePatient` module.

The `TriagePatient` class is publicly derived from the `Patient` class. The `TriagePatient` class introduces one character pointer member variable to dynamically hold the symptoms of the arriving patient for the triage center.

The `TriagePatient` class includes a default constructor, implements the pure virtual type() function, and re-implements the two read and write virtual functions of the base class `Patient`. It adheres to the rule of three in derived classes to properly manage the dynamically allocated memory of the class and the base class during copying and assignment.

### Symptoms Character Pointer Member Variable
Create a character pointer member variable to point to a dynamically allocated Cstring holding the list of symptoms of the `TriagePatient`. Although this characters Cstring is held dynamically but we will make sure it will not be more than 512 character. In such case where the lenght of the data exceeds 512, the data will be truncated and the rest of it will be silently ingnored. 


### Default Constructor
The default constructor initializes the character pointer member variable to null, passes the `nextTriageTicket` global variable to the constructor of the base class `Patient`, and then increases the value of `nextTriageTicket` by `one`.

### the type() virtual function
This function returns the character **'T'**;

### write virtual function override.
This function inserts the patient information into different instances of `ostream`.

If the ostream reference is `cout`, it prints a "TRIAGE" label, inserts the patient, and displays the symptoms. If it is `clog`, it only prints the patient information in a linear format with no symptoms. If it is neither `cout` nor `clog`, it inserts the information in a comma-separated format.

- If the `ostream` reference is `cout`
   - Inserts the word `"TRIAGE"` into the `ostream` and goes to a newline.
- Calls the patient's write method.
- If the `ostream` reference is `cout`
   - Inserts `"Symptoms: "` into the `ostream`.
   - Inserts the patient's symptoms into the `ostream`.
   - Goes to a newline.
- If the ostream reference is not `clog` (clog is only used for linear printouts)
   - Inserts a "`,`" and then the patient's symptoms.

The function ends by returning the ostream reference.

### read virtual function override. 
This function extracts patient information from different instances of `istream`:

- Console entry via `cin`
- Comma-separated values entry via any other `istream` objects.

It performs the following steps:

- Deletes the memory pointed to by the symptoms member variable.
- Calls the Read function of the base class `Patient`.
- If the `istream` reference is not `cin`:
   - Ignores the comma character.
   - Reads the symptoms of the patient into a local Cstring character array, up to 511 characters or until a newline `('\n')` is encountered.
   - Allocates memory and copies the local symptoms Cstring into the allocated memory.
   - Sets the `nextTriageTicket` global variable to the return value of the `number()` member function of the `Patient` class plus `one`.
- Otherwise:
   - Displays the prompt `"Symptoms: "`.
   - Reads the symptoms into the local Cstring, up to 511 characters.
   - Allocates memory and copies the local symptoms Cstring into the allocated memory.

In case the `istream` fails, it deletes the dynamically allocated memory and sets the pointer to nullptr.

The function concludes by returning the istream reference.

### Destructor
Deletes the memory pointed by the [symptoms member variable](#symptoms-character-pointer-member-variable)
